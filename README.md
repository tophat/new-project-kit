# New Project Kit

## How to use this repository

This repository covers some must-haves when starting a project so you don't have to. Things like setting up a basic CI configuration, a README, issue templates and whatnot.

To get started, take out this __How to__ section, replace __New Project Kit__ with your project's name and fill up the README template below!

## Overview

_At a high-level, what is your project about? What problem does it solve? This is the first thing people will see when landing on your repository, make it snappy!_

## Motivation

_This can be an extension of the Overview describing your problem space. It's a cool way to give an origin story to your project._

## Installation

_How can users set up your project? Through npm/yarn? Through a manual installer and some cURL magic? Be as thorough as you can!_

## Usage

_Once installed, how can your users make it work?_

## Uninstalling

_If there is a specific procedure to uninstall your project that isn't straightforward and/or well-defined, you should outline it here to avoid frustrations._

## Contributing

_Instructions or guidelines on how to contribute are essential to any OSS project! You can easily split this off to a CONTRIBUTING document alongside the README, or keep it in here._

_In your contribution guide, you can outline best practices, how to set up a development environment that meets the needs of your project, and what the process is to get contributions merged._

## Contributors

_You don't really have to add this section yourself! Simply use [all-contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) by adding comments in your PRs like so:_

```
@all-contributors please add <username> for <contribution type>
```

_Find out more about All-Contributors on their website!_
